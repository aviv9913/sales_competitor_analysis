They said other companies like N-able give you a ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù version where they put you under their tenant and you can‚Äôt see full compliance reports and other stuff he wasn‚Äôt sure on the specifics. \n\nWondering if you guys have any insight on this ?",

It was garbage. I think they stopped selling it two years ago. \n\nBack then and now today, you can get S1 Complete with Vigilance, direct from N-able and manage it directly at S1. You will still be under N-able‚Äôs tenant, but can still add your own customers and assign logins to them at their level. I believe some add-on SKUs like Ranger for AD are not yet available due to N-able billing issues, but that may no longer be the case. They sometimes call it ‚Äúoutergrated EDR‚Äù or ‚Äústandalone EDR‚Äù at N-able. \n\nMy guess is the CW S1 is like this second N-able offering.",

Even spent a number of  years as a independent CW consultant working with MSP's all over the world get setup and customize their stack.  At this point we are pretty much walking away from their entire stack.  Automate is not getting any Dev work, RMM is not a usable product and won't be for atleast 2 years if ever, CW Sell breaks and their own support can't fix it, Manage is still decent until it breaks and then good luck getting support to be useful.  We do IT risk assessments with all of our vendors now and I can't even explain how low CW scored as a company.",
