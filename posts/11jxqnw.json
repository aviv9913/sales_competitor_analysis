    "title": "Crowdstrike vs SentinelOne",
    "text": "Hey guys, we are an MSP with 1000 endpoints currently using webroot. We understand it isn't good enough and nearing the end of our POC evaluation for both sentinelone and crowdstrike. I can say I've had pretty good experiences with both so far but I have seen Crowdstrike be able to detect more things (fileless attacks), seen less false positives and also be a lighter agent on the machines we've tested.  Also Crowdstrike's sales engineer went above and beyond with helping setup best practices etc.\n\nI've done my research and it appears Crowdstrike much more often than not test better in independent evaluations like MITRE and be rated better (gartner). Sentinelone seems still to be mentioned 5/6 times more in these threads. \nI'd like to do my due diligence in questioning CS to make sure I make a good decision. Are most people's decision to not go Crowdstrike due to:\n1. barrier to entry (minimums)\n2. Slightly higher pricing?\n3. Easy consumption model (pax8)?\n\nI'd love to understand anyone else's viewpoint for other reasons!",

People are needed 24x7 live eyes on glass to make the real difference. When you buy a NGAV, EDR, and get a live fully staffed SOC you now have an MDR.  Not all and MDRs are created equal. Make sure to do a deep investigation on their response capabilities and remediation.  Do they provide you log retention to help with regulatory compliance? Do they provide configuration assistance, support, and auditing?  Can they give you a consumption based model so you truly only need to buy what youâ€™re using?  What are the lengths of their contracts? Can they do month-to-month with no annual commit.  Are they committed 100% to the channel?  While the technology is important the people and process or more important. Also how many SOCs do you want to work with because MDR is just part of the battle.  Can they provide CDR, NDR, and XDR?  Not all players really do XDR even when they say they do",
