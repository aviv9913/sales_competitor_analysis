    "text": "Ok so now just finding out about the bullshit minimum spend for Pax8 with less than 2 months notice.\n\n0-$499. $500 or above no $25/month fee. So I'm gonna raise the rates mid contract for certain customers and expect to get away with that? That customer is gonna walk when their contract is done. For the grief, time, and money this company has cost me with their inadequate support & clueless reps it's not worth it.\n\nHaven't been happy with them since my first shit interaction.\n\nWho else resells SentinelOne Complete other than Pax8?",
