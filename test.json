It‚Äôs a lead generation problem.\n\nHere‚Äôs the fact about that.\n\n‚ùå Without a¬†tried, replicable lead generation machine, your mid-market MSP will keep hemorrhaging cash in the name of advertising/marketing.\n\nYou don‚Äôt want that.\n\nWe‚Äôre at a point in the world economy where you can‚Äôt afford to take chances.\n\nYou can‚Äôt afford to be unsure of what marketing channels to focus on.\n\nA little bit of Facebook Messenger and a little bit of cold calling isn‚Äôt going to get you leads consistently and reliably at this point (it never really has).\n\n‚û°Ô∏è You need a lead generation system that works for MSPs looking to attract 50 - 250 seat leads ONLINE. One that you can rely on to get you out of the lead drought you‚Äôre currently facing.\n\nBecause every business is trimming expenses, many are taking IT management in-house‚Ä¶\n\nIf (for any reason) a client needs to ‚Äúpause‚Äù their contract, you need to know that you‚Äôre not waiting on the next referral to make up for that.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, you‚Äôve heard it before. A recession isn‚Äôt the time to back down. It‚Äôs the time to take advantage of the quietness in the market, and seize a larger market share than you‚Äôve ever had.\n\nNow, I‚Äôll be the first to tell you that at MSP Launchpad, we‚Äôre not magicians‚Ä¶üö´\n\n‚úÖ But we‚Äôve been at this long enough to know exactly what works to attract the kinds of businesses you want (and need to attract) to ramp up your MRR and grow in a recession.\n\n‚úÖ We‚Äôve already helped dozens of MSPs across the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe generate 3 - 10 leads per month (see some testimonials¬†[here](https://www.msplaunchpad.com/testimonials?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_term=weekly_post&utm_content=testimonial&utm_campaign=msp_website_weekly_thread&utm_source_platform=&utm_creative_format=reddit_thread&utm_marketing_tactic=reddit_testimonials)).\n\nNow it‚Äôs your turn.
